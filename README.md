Welcome to __Instasent Python SDK__. This repository contains Python SDK for Instasent's REST API.

# Notice!

> **Verify** product is currently deprecated and will be removed in the next release. The same functionality can be easily implemented by sending an SMS. If you need help migrating please contact usage

## Installation

The easiest way to install the SDK is either via pip:

```
$ pip install instasent
```

or manually by downloading the source and run the setup.py script:

```
$ python setup.py install
```

# Usage

Check the [examples directory](https://github.com/instasent/instasent-python-lib/tree/master/examples) to see working examples of this SDK usage

### Sending an SMS

```python
import instasent

client = instasent.Client('my-token')
response = client.send_sms('Company', '+34666666666', 'test message')

print response['response_code']
print response['response_body']
```

If you want to send an Unicode SMS (i.e with ðŸ˜€ emoji) you only need to replace `send_sms` call to `send_sms_unicode`

```python
response = client.send_sms_unicode('Company', '+34666666666', 'Unicode test: Ã±a Ã©Ã¡Ã­Ã³Ãº ðŸ˜€')
```

## Available actions

```
SMS
instasent.send_sms(sender, to, text)
instasent.send_sms_unicode(sender, to, text)
instasent.get_sms(page, per_page)
instasent.get_sms_by_id(message_id)

LOOKUP
instasent.do_lookup(to)
instasent.get_lookup_by_id(id)
instasent.get_lookups(page, per_page)

ACCOUNT
instasent.get_account_balance()
```
